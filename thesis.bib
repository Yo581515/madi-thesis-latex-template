abstract = "Enormous amounts of time series are being collected in many different domains. These include, but are not limited to, aviation, computing, energy, finance, logistics, and medicine. However, general-purpose Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are not optimized for times series management and thus significantly limit the amount of time series that can be efficiently stored and analyzed. As a remedy, specialized Time Series Management Systems (TSMSs) have been developed. This chapter, provides a thorough survey and classification of TSMSs that are developed through academic or industrial research and documented through peer-reviewed papers. To document their design and novel contributions, a summary of each system is provided. The systems are primarily classified based on their architecture. In addition, the systems are classified based on: when and why each system was developed, how it can be deployed, how mature its implementation is, how scalable it is, how it processes time series, what interfaces it provides, the type of approximation it supports, how low latency it can achieve, how it stores time series, and the types of queries it supports. The chapter concludes with a collection of open research problems based on the limitations of the surveyed systems.",

abstract = {Smart objects are increasingly widespread and their ecosystem, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT), is relevant in many application scenarios. The huge amount of temporally annotated data produced by these smart devices demands efficient techniques for the transfer and storage of time series data. Compression techniques play an important role toward this goal and, even though standard compression methods could be used with some benefit, there exist several ones that specifically address the case of time series by exploiting their peculiarities to achieve more effective compression and more accurate decompression in the case of lossy compression techniques. This article provides a state-of-the-art survey of the principal time series compression techniques, proposing a taxonomy to classify them considering their overall approach and their characteristics. Furthermore, we analyze the performances of the selected algorithms by discussing and comparing the experimental results that were provided in the original articles.The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive and homogeneous reconstruction of the state-of-the-art, which is currently fragmented across many articles that use different notations and where the proposed methods are not organized according to a classification.},

abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data.. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower bounding, but very tight Euclidean distance approximation and show how they can support fast exact searching, and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.},

abstract = {We present an efficient indexing method to locate 1-dimensional subsequences within a collection of sequences, such that the subsequences match a given (query) pattern within a specified tolerance. The idea is to map each data sequences into a small set of multidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then, these rectangles can be readily indexed using traditional spatial access methods, like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which  are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case efficiently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements). We compared the method to sequential scanning, which is the only obvious competitor. The results were excellent: our method accelerated the search time from 3 times up to 100 times.},

These applications require efficient management of the time-series data on both the edge and cloud side that support high throughput ingestion, low latency query and advanced time series analysis. In this demonstration, we present Apache IoTDB managing time-series data to enable new classes of IoT applications. IoTDB has both edge and cloud versions, provides an optimized columnar file format for efficient time-series data storage, and time-series database with high ingestion rate, low latency queries and data analysis support. It is specially optimized for time-series oriented operations like aggregations query, down-sampling and sub-sequence similarity search. An edge-to-cloud time-series data management application is chosen to demonstrate how IoTDB handles time-series data in real-time and supports advanced analytics by integrating with Hadoop and Spark. An end-to-end IoT data management solution is shown by integrating IoTDB with PLC4x, Calcite, and Grafana.},
